      <p>
        As we remember this weekend the Savior’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem
        shortly before His atoning sacrifice, I recall His words of hope and
        comfort: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me,
        though he were dead, yet shall he live.”1 I love Him. I believe Him. I
        testify that He is the Resurrection and the Life. This testimony has
        comforted and strengthened me during the past four and a half years
        since my wife, Barbara, passed away. I miss her.
