            YouTube is a perfect example of balanced delivery that positively
            influences the user experience. The application is divided into
            reels, publications and general videos sections. It is easy to
            navigate between them and the colors and sizes of each division are
            in harmony with the rest of the page.

          <p>
            For the most part, streaming video platforms are one of the most
            consistent when it comes to the use of "replay". In the case of
            Disney+ we can see that the home page already provides us with a
            specific layout based on squares (vertical rectangles) containing
            the titles of the movies or series to offer. In the same way, if we
            search for a specific series through the search bar, the results
            will be organized in the same way. This makes the user feel
            comfortable and quickly access the information they need.

          <p>
            Consistency goes hand in hand with design, something that is not
            consistent is usually not appealing to the eye. I think Instagram is
            a great example. We have completely specific Tabs. The one for
            chats, the one for posts, and the one for reels. When you navigate
            through them, it makes it very easy to find your way around because
            they have the same basic functions and allows the user to engage
            with the social networking experience.
